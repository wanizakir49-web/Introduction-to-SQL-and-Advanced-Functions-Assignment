        "\n",
        "\n",
        "SQL is broadly divided into different sub-languages based on their functionality. The three most important among them are DDL, DML, and DQL.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Data Definition Language (DDL)** is used to define and manage the structure of database objects. It deals with schema-level operations. Commands such as CREATE, ALTER, DROP, and TRUNCATE come under DDL. For example, CREATE TABLE is used to define the columns, data types, and constraints of a table. DDL commands permanently change the database structure and are auto-committed.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Data Manipulation Language (DML)** is used to manipulate data stored inside tables. Common commands include INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE. These commands do not affect the structure of the database but operate on the records. DML commands can be rolled back if transactions are used.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Data Query Language (DQL)** is primarily concerned with retrieving data from the database. The SELECT statement is the core of DQL and is widely used for reporting and analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "```sql\n",
        "CREATE TABLE Student(ID INT, Name VARCHAR(50));\n",
        "INSERT INTO Student VALUES (1, 'Ali');\n",
        "SELECT * FROM Student;\n",
        "```\n",
